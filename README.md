# jscodegen.py

Similar to [escodegen](https://github.com/estools/escodegen), jscodegen.py is a library that generates JavaScript from a AST in [Mozilla Parser API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/Parser_API) style. However, it is wip and not yet as sophisticated as escodegen.
